# Zeyin — AR Focus Therapy (Prototype)

Zeyin is an early-stage prototype focused on improving concentration and preventing cognitive overload in students and young people.

The project combines:
- focus timers (Pomodoro-style),
- short focus quests,
- and a lightweight community space  
to build healthier focus habits with minimal pressure.

## 🎯 Problem
Many students struggle with attention fragmentation, constant notifications, and burnout.  
Existing productivity apps focus on efficiency, not mental well-being.

## 💡 Solution
Zeyin approaches focus as **therapy, not productivity**:
- short, guided focus sessions,
- minimalistic interface to reduce overstimulation,
- community reflection instead of competition.

This repository contains a **working prototype**, not a finished product.

## 🧪 Current Features
- Focus timer (25 min sessions)
- Quest-based focus tasks
- Community feed (local prototype)
- Simple login (demo, no password)

## 🚧 Status
This is an **early prototype** built for experimentation and validation.  
AR features and therapeutic mechanics are planned next.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Next.js (App Router)
- React
- TypeScript
- LocalStorage (prototype state)

## 📌 Note
This project is under active development and was created for an application / pitch submission.
